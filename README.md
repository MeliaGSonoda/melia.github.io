## About Melia

I was living life, and then it all fell apart. What did I do? I decided to deploy Plan B.


### Family

I am married and have three children. We live in Boise and love to wear matching shirts on Christmas day.

### Work

Most of my time is spent working as a business analyst for [Adeptive Software](https://www.adeptivesw.com/). Although much of my awake time is spent at work, I also have time to go to school and pursue my hobbies.

### School

After working in the title and escrow industry for 14 years, I finally figured out what I want to be when I grow up. I am now a computer science student at Boise State University. My goal is to move into a software development position with my current employer.

### Hobbies

I am an aerial student and instructor at [Ophidia Studio](http://ophidiastudio.com/). I decided to take my first aerial class because it looked like a fun and different out-of-my-comfort-zone way to be active, and I hoped it would help me overcome my fear of heights. I was immediately addicted and have not looked back since.
